# Game-bot
Bot for playing games??

If you somehow found this on github and wanna see me suffer coding and debugging stuff you can join my [bot test server](https://discord.gg/kscA7eF9tx) or add me on discord @Sopy#7207

Also if you want to try the bot out you can [add it to your own server](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=824581100868599808&permissions=-1&scope=bot) I will be hosting it 24/7 while in active developemet.

# Current features
## 2048
Well, it's the old 2048 game, you merge blocks to get to 2048. *Best experience on mobile discord.*

**If you are going to download the bot you will need to add the emoji to your server**
**The custom emoji can be found [here](https://imgur.com/a/uN2q9at)**
